      "1. **Clear Instruction on Verification**: Encouraging a double-check against the document's content for critical information or discrepancies before providing an answer.\n" +
      '\n' +
      '2. **Specific Information Highlighting**: When seeking specific details (such as educational qualifications), emphasizing the importance of carefully reading and extracting exact data from the document might help in avoiding inaccurate answers.\n' +
      '\n' +
      '3. **Encouragement of Detailed Document Exploration**: For broad questions related to personal or professional details, a reminder to explore all sections of the document thoroughly could be beneficial. This is crucial in cases where multiple mentions might exist, potentially leading to confusion.\n' +
      '\n' +
      '4. **Prompt for Clarification**: In cases where the answer might depend on interpretation or be subject to multiple valid responses (like different dates or locations mentioned in different contexts), suggesting to ask for clarification or additional context.\n' +
      '\n' +
      '5. **Use Search and Quote Functions**: Encouraging the use of the search function within the document to locate relevant information quickly and the quote function to provide direct excerpts as evidence could also improve accuracy and trustworthiness of answers.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Implementing these strategies could significantly enhance the accuracy of responses and user satisfaction.'
